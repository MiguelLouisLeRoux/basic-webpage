                 <p>Located in the heart of Cape Town, the Castle of Good Hope is the oldest surviving structure in South Africa with incredible history. Easily recognized by its mustard yellow exterior and stunning backdrop view of Table Mountain, the castle continues to draw tourists to its location as a popular attraction. The castle has several scheduled tours throughout the day including a Castle After Dark tour, where visitors can explore the supposedly haunted hallways in the evening.</p>

                 <p>Located in Wale Street, St George's Cathedral is the oldest cathedral in Southern Africa. The church serves as a mother church of the Anglican district of Cape Town, built by Sir Herbert Baker out of sandstone from Table Mountain. It is a stunning example of the Victorian-era design with magnificent stained glass windows, a crypt, and a restaurant on site as well. The central panel of the great west window is dominated by the figure of the triumphant Christ.</p>
